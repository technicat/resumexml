XML format and XSL converters to generate HTML, PDF, and RTF resumes (that last one was for recruiters, so they can remove your contact info and add buzzwords).

For a while, I maintained my resume in XML and ran it through XSL/FOP/JFOR to create various presentations.

The stylesheets are MIT license, but of course not my resume itself (it's really old, anyway).
